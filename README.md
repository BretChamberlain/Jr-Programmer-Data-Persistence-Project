Still taking in a lot of information. Lots of things to learn. This tutorial hit me with github and json. Had no clue what these were.
Would assume making a high score roster would invole a list/array. Unsure which one however.
If highscore would keep track of multiple scores a Time.deltaTime/or some measurement of time would need to be added to the save file.
